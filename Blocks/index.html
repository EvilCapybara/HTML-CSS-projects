    <h1>Why Do Animals Like Capybaras So Much?</h1>
     <p>The photo evidence of the capybara's friendliness and the animal friendships that they are capable to form was more than convincing. Each and every one of domestic and wild animals seem to like hanging out with this friendly creature that looks like a rat-pig hybrid. Even the crocodiles!
The answer? It probably lies in some capybara facts. First of all these cute animals are very social and often live in groups of 10-20 individuals. This lovable creature is the largest rodent in the world. </p>
